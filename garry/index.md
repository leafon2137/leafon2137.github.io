![Like literally, this looks dope](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/709368324605345865/867746871194943488/unknown.png  "Garry's +search command")
 
   Like legit, this looks dope, right?

**Garry also has other commands:**
- -profile (View a profile of a certain player!)
- -guess (Guess a player judging by their icon (i dont think this is even possible))
- -player-search (Go through a certain players levels :D)
- -challenge
     - roulette (The extreme demon roulette, but in discord)
         - insane (Basically insane demon roulette)
         - hard (hard demon roulette)
         - medium (medium demon roulette)
         - easy (easy demon roulette)
     - rng-lay (randomized layout - gives you a specific song id, gamemode, speed etc. that you have to use for your layout)
- -recent (Explore the recent tab without opening geometry dash)
- -recent-rate (Recently rated levels :D)
Thats all for now. But i'm gonna add more stuff such as:
- Exploring the [demonlist](https://pointercrate.com/demonlist) through Garry
- Seeing the leaderboards of a certain level
